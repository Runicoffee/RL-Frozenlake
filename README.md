# RL-Frozenlake
Reinforcement learning project with FrozenLake
This project implements reinforcement learning (Q-Learning) using Frozen lake environment.
We use both deterministic and non-deterministic uppdate rule and we study how that affects the performance in both deterministic 
and non-deterministic (slippery or non-slippery) environments.
Graphs are drawn to display performance as a function of episodes.
